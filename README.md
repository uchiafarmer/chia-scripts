# Chia-Tools

Small scripts for Chia farming
----

### Plotfilter

* **plotfilter.sh** -- A small script to separate OG plots from NFT plots

#### To use:

* Run the script as-is with `./plotfilter.sh -t /path/to/plots`
* Or install it with `./install.sh`
   * Then use it as an installed program: `plotfilter`
   * This allows you to change to the desired directory, and run the script in the directory you are working in.

*More scripts will be added when needed ..*
